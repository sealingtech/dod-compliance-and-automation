  desc  'Systemd contains an ability to set fallback DNS servers which is used for DNS lookups in the event no system level DNS servers are configured or other DNS servers are specified in the Systemd resolved.conf file. If uncommented this configuration contains Google DNS servers by default and could result in DNS leaking info unknowingly in the event DNS is absent or misconfigured at the system level.'

    At the command line, execute the following command:

    # resolvectl status | grep 'Fallback DNS'

    If the output indicates that Fallback DNS servers are configured, this is a finding.

    Navigate to and open:

    /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/vracli_resolved.conf

    At the end of the file add or update the \"FallbackDNS\" entry to the following:

    FallbackDNS=

    Restart the Systemd resolved service by running the following command:

    # systemctl restart systemd-resolved

    Note: If this option is not given, a compiled-in list of DNS servers is used instead, which is undesirable.
